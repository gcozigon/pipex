# pipex
Pipex is a project designed to help understand Unix processes, file descriptors, and piping between commands. The goal is to recreate the functionality of the shell pipeline (|).  This project is written in C and demonstrates how to manage process creation, redirection of input/output, and piping using low-level Unix system calls.
